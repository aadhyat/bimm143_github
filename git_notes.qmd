##  Basics of using git

Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that is very popular. 

The core steps to using git involve

1. Initiate a git repository
   In RStudio, we just click a little radio button on project creation. 
   At the command line, we type:
   `git init`
   
2. Do your normal work. (Add files, modify files, etc.)

3. Add your important files to the "stage".
   In RStudio, we click the "Staged" radio button in the git tab.
   In the command line: 
   `git add yourfilname`

4. Commit your staged files to the repository.
   In RStudio, you just hit the "Commit" button in the git tab.
   In the command line, you type:
   `git commit -m "any notes"`
   
You can check your project history and status:
    `git status`
    `git log` (push Q to exit)
